# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using three supervised machine learning models: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest**. It aims to assist in the early detection of heart conditions by analyzing key medical features and comparing model performance.

## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and normalization  
- Model training with SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest  
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
- Comparison and selection of the best-performing model  

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci), which includes features such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Cholesterol levels  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting ECG results  
- Max heart rate achieved  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- ST depression, and more  

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest**  


## 📈 Results

All three models were trained and evaluated using classification metrics. Results show:

- **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy  
- **SVM** and **Logistic Regression** performed well on normalized features  
- Overall, ensemble methods showed better generalization  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 💡 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in the healthcare domain to support early diagnosis and risk prediction of heart disease using real patient data.
